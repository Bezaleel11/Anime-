    <p id="intro">erserk (Japanese: ベルセルク, Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
        Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the characters of
        Guts, a lone swordsman, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band of the Hawk". The series
        follows Guts' journey seeking revenge on Griffith, who betrayed him and sacrificed his comrades to become a
        powerful demonic being. </p>
